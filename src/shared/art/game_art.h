// Each game's own pictures, read from the player's disc and cached as PNG files in the game's data folder: its logo,
// its background art, its title icon, its toy portraits and (Giants) its large toy artworks. One flow for every game; what differs per game (which
// archive, which picture) is the table in game_art.cpp. Used by the in-game Toy Box and by Skylauncher (game page,
// sidebar, collection). Nothing is shipped or downloaded. docs/runtime/host/game_art.md.
