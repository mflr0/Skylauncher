// Where everything of the player's lives (docs/getting-started/settings.md): one folder per OS, "Skylanders", shared by the game, the
// launcher and SSABuild. Plain C++ and the C library only (no SDL), so SSABuild can use it too.
//
//   <root>/Collection/      the figures, shared by every game          (collection.h)
//   <root>/launcher.ini     the settings shared by the games and the launcher
//   <root>/kit/             the kits the launcher downloaded, <release tag>/ each
//   <root>/toolchains/      the compilers SSABuild downloads (Windows)
//   <root>/logs/            the launcher's logs, migration.log
//   <root>/<Game>/          one per game ("SSA"): the built game, its settings, saves, pipelines.bin, portal.txt,
//                           figures, portraits, launcher-cache and SSARecomp.log
//
// <root> is SKYLANDERS_DATA (tests, portable use), else %APPDATA%\Skylanders on Windows, ~/Library/Application
// Support/Skylanders on macOS and $XDG_DATA_HOME/Skylanders (~/.local/share/Skylanders) elsewhere. Nothing here
// creates a folder.

    //
    // Before, the game kept its data in <roaming>/SSARecomp (and, nested, <roaming>/SSARecomp/SSARecomp), Skylauncher
    // its games and kits in its own folder (%LOCALAPPDATA%\Skylauncher on Windows), SSABuild its compilers in
    // %LOCALAPPDATA%\SSARecomp\toolchains. Migrate() moves them into the layout above:
    //  - entries are RENAMED, one by one; a source that is gone is skipped, so a half-done run is finished by the next;
    //  - nothing is overwritten or deleted: when the target exists the moved entry is kept beside it as
    //    "<name>.old-<time>", unless the target already holds all of its bytes (an interrupted copy), then the source
    //    is the leftover and goes;
    //  - when a rename fails the entry is copied to a temporary name, checked byte for byte, renamed into place, and
    //    only then deleted; if even that fails it stays where it was (reported as failed, retried next time);
    //  - an old folder is removed only once it is empty;
    //  - every action is logged in <root>/logs/migration.log;
    //  - the absolute paths in <root>/launcher.ini that point into a moved folder are rewritten.
    // xbox-signing (Xbox development only) stays in the old SSARecomp folder.
    // Pure: it touches only the folders it is given.
