// Reading and editing what Spyro's Adventure stores on a figure. Layout (docs/runtime/host/figures.md):
// - sector 0 (blocks 0-3) is plain: serial, toy type, variant, header CRC; blocks 4-7 are plain (Swap Force writes block 6,
//   kept as it is here);
// - blocks 8-63 except the sector trailers are AES-128 encrypted, each with its own key:
//   MD5(block 0 | block 1 | block number | " Copyright (C) 2010 Activision. All Rights Reserved. "); zero blocks stay zero;
// - the progress is stored twice, in area A (blocks 8-16) and area B (blocks 36-44), 7 data blocks each; the title
//   writes the area it did not read last, with the sequence number + 1, so a write cut short keeps the other one;
// - Giants and later add a second pair, the extra areas (blocks 17-21 and 45-49, 4 data blocks each, same A/B scheme):
//   Giants' part of the experience (levels 11-15) and its hat. Spyro's Adventure never touches them.
